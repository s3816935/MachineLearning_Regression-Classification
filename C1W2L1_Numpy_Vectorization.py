# NumPy is a library that extends the base capabilities of python to add a richer data set including more numeric types, vectors, matrices, and many matrix functions. NumPy and python  work together fairly seamlessly. Python arithmetic operators work on NumPy data types and many NumPy functions will accept python data types.



# Data creation routines in NumPy will generally have a first parameter which is the shape of the object. This can either be a single value for a 1-D result or a tuple (n,m,...) specifying the shape of the result. Below are examples of creating vectors using these routines.

# NumPy routines which allocate memory and fill arrays with value
a = np.zeros(4);                print(f"np.zeros(4) :   a = {a}, a shape = {a.shape}, a data type = {a.dtype}")
a = np.zeros((4,));             print(f"np.zeros(4,) :  a = {a}, a shape = {a.shape}, a data type = {a.dtype}")
a = np.random.random_sample(4); print(f"np.random.random_sample(4): a = {a}, a shape = {a.shape}, a data type = {a.dtype}")

# Some data creation routines do not take a shape tuple:

# NumPy routines which allocate memory and fill arrays with value but do not accept shape as input argument
a = np.arange(4.);              print(f"np.arange(4.):     a = {a}, a shape = {a.shape}, a data type = {a.dtype}")
a = np.random.rand(4);          print(f"np.random.rand(4): a = {a}, a shape = {a.shape}, a data type = {a.dtype}")

# values can be specified manually as well. 

# NumPy routines which allocate memory and fill with user specified values
a = np.array([5,4,3,2]);  print(f"np.array([5,4,3,2]):  a = {a},     a shape = {a.shape}, a data type = {a.dtype}")
a = np.array([5.,4,3,2]); print(f"np.array([5.,4,3,2]): a = {a}, a shape = {a.shape}, a data type = {a.dtype}")

# These have all created a one-dimensional vector  `a` with four elements. `a.shape` returns the dimensions. Here we see a.shape = `(4,)` indicating a 1-d array with 4 elements.  


# # Operations on Vectors
# # Indexing
# **Indexing** means referring to *an element* of an array by its position within the array.  
# **Slicing** means getting a *subset* of elements from an array based on their indices.  

#vector indexing operations on 1-D vectors
a = np.arange(10)
print(a)

#access an element
print(f"a[2].shape: {a[2].shape} a[2]  = {a[2]}, Accessing an element returns a scalar")

# access the last element, negative indexes count from the end
print(f"a[-1] = {a[-1]}")

#indexs must be within the range of the vector or they will produce and error
try:
    c = a[10]
except Exception as e:
    print("The error message you'll see is:")
    print(e)

# # Slicing
# Slicing creates an array of indices using a set of three values (`start:stop:step`). A subset of values is also valid. Its use is best explained by example:

#vector slicing operations
a = np.arange(10)
print(f"a         = {a}")

#access 5 consecutive elements (start:stop:step)
c = a[2:7:1];     print("a[2:7:1] = ", c)

# access 3 elements separated by two 
c = a[2:7:2];     print("a[2:7:2] = ", c)

# access all elements index 3 and above
c = a[3:];        print("a[3:]    = ", c)

# access all elements below index 3
c = a[:3];        print("a[:3]    = ", c)

# access all elements
c = a[:];         print("a[:]     = ", c)


# # Single vector operations
# There are a number of useful operations that involve operations on a single vector.

a = np.array([1,2,3,4])
print(f"a             : {a}")
# negate elements of a
b = -a 
print(f"b = -a        : {b}")

# sum all elements of a, returns a scalar
b = np.sum(a) 
print(f"b = np.sum(a) : {b}")

b = np.mean(a)
print(f"b = np.mean(a): {b}")

b = a**2
print(f"b = a**2      : {b}")

# # Vector Vector element-wise operations
# Most of the NumPy arithmetic, logical and comparison operations apply to vectors as well. These operators work on an element-by-element basis. For example 
# $$ c_i = a_i + b_i $$

a = np.array([ 1, 2, 3, 4])
b = np.array([-1,-2, 3, 4])
print(f"Binary operators work element wise: {a + b}")

# Of course, for this to work correctly, the vectors must be of the same size:

#try a mismatched vector operation
c = np.array([1, 2])
try:
    d = a + c
except Exception as e:
    print("The error message you'll see is:")
    print(e)


# # Scalar Vector operations
# Vectors can be 'scaled' by scalar values. A scalar value is just a number. The scalar multiplies all the elements of the vector.

a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])

# multiply a by a scalar
b = 5 * a 
print(f"b = 5 * a : {b}")

# # Vector Vector dot product
# The dot product is a mainstay of Linear Algebra and NumPy. This is an operation used extensively in this course and should be well understood. 

def my_dot(a, b): 
    """
   Compute the dot product of two vectors
 
    Args:
      a (ndarray (n,)):  input vector 
      b (ndarray (n,)):  input vector with same dimension as a
    
    Returns:

    """
    x=0
    for i in range(a.shape[0]):
        x = x + a[i] * b[i]
    return x

# test 1-D
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
b = np.array([-1, 4, 3, 2])
print(f"my_dot(a, b) = {my_dot(a, b)}")

# The dot product is expected to return a scalar value. 
# Try the same operations using `np.dot`.  

# test 1-D
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])

# # The Need for Speed: vector vs for loop
# We utilized the NumPy  library because it improves speed memory efficiency. Let's demonstrate:

np.random.seed(1)
a = np.random.rand(10000000)  # very large arrays
b = np.random.rand(10000000)

tic = time.time()  # capture start time
c = np.dot(a, b)
toc = time.time()  # capture end time

print(f"np.dot(a, b) =  {c:.4f}")
print(f"Vectorized version duration: {1000*(toc-tic):.4f} ms ")

tic = time.time()  # capture start time
c = my_dot(a,b)
toc = time.time()  # capture end time

print(f"my_dot(a, b) =  {c:.4f}")
print(f"loop version duration: {1000*(toc-tic):.4f} ms ")

del(a);del(b)  #remove these big arrays from memory

# So, vectorization provides a large speed up in this example. This is because NumPy makes better use of available data parallelism in the underlying hardware. GPU's and modern CPU's implement Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) pipelines allowing multiple operations to be issued in parallel. This is critical in Machine Learning where the data sets are often very large.


# # Vector Vector operations

X = np.array([[1],[2],[3],[4]])
w = np.array([2])
c = np.dot(X[1], w)

print(f"X[1] has shape {X[1].shape}")
print(f"w has shape {w.shape}")
print(f"c has shape {c.shape}")


# # Matrices
# # Abstract
# Matrices, are two dimensional arrays. The elements of a matrix are all of the same type. In notation, matrices are denoted with capitol, bold letter such as $\mathbf{X}$. In this and other labs, `m` is often the number of rows and `n` the number of columns. The elements of a matrix can be referenced with a two dimensional index. In math settings, numbers in the index typically run from 1 to n. In computer science and these labs, indexing will run from 0 to n-1.

# ## 4.2 NumPy Arrays
# 
# NumPy's basic data structure is an indexable, n-dimensional *array* containing elements of the same type (`dtype`). These were described earlier. Matrices have a two-dimensional (2-D) index [m,n].
# 
# In Course 1, 2-D matrices are used to hold training data. Training data is $m$ examples by $n$ features creating an (m,n) array. Course 1 does not do operations directly on matrices but typically extracts an example as a vector and operates on that. Below you will review: 
# - data creation
# - slicing and indexing


# # Matrix Creation
# The same functions that created 1-D vectors will create 2-D or n-D arrays. Here are some examples
# 

# Below, the shape tuple is provided to achieve a 2-D result. Notice how NumPy uses brackets to denote each dimension. Notice further than NumPy, when printing, will print one row per line.
# 

a = np.zeros((1, 5))                                       
print(f"a shape = {a.shape}, a = {a}")                     

a = np.zeros((2, 1))                                                                   
print(f"a shape = {a.shape}, a = {a}") 

a = np.random.random_sample((1, 1))  
print(f"a shape = {a.shape}, a = {a}") 

# One can also manually specify data. Dimensions are specified with additional brackets matching the format in the printing above.

# NumPy routines which allocate memory and fill with user specified values
a = np.array([[5], [4], [3]]);   print(f" a shape = {a.shape}, np.array: a = {a}")
a = np.array([[5],   # One can also
              [4],   # separate values
              [3]]); #into separate rows
print(f" a shape = {a.shape}, np.array: a = {a}")


# # Operations on Matrices
# # Indexing

# Matrices include a second index. The two indexes describe [row, column]. Access can either return an element or a row/column. 
a = np.arange(6).reshape(-1, 2)   #reshape is a convenient way to create matrices
print(f"a.shape: {a.shape}, \na= {a}")

#access an element
print(f"\na[2,0].shape:   {a[2, 0].shape}, a[2,0] = {a[2, 0]},     type(a[2,0]) = {type(a[2, 0])} Accessing an element returns a scalar\n")

#access a row
print(f"a[2].shape:   {a[2].shape}, a[2]   = {a[2]}, type(a[2])   = {type(a[2])}")

# It is worth drawing attention to the last example. Accessing a matrix by just specifying the row will return a *1-D vector*.

# **Reshape**  
# The previous example used [reshape](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.reshape.html) to shape the array.  
# `a = np.arange(6).reshape(-1, 2) `   
# This line of code first created a *1-D Vector* of six elements. It then reshaped that vector into a *2-D* array using the reshape command. This could have been written:  
# `a = np.arange(6).reshape(3, 2) `  
# To arrive at the same 3 row, 2 column array.
# The -1 argument tells the routine to compute the number of rows given the size of the array and the number of columns.
# 


# # Slicing
# Slicing creates an array of indices using a set of three values (`start:stop:step`). A subset of values is also valid. Its use is best explained by example:

#vector 2-D slicing operations
a = np.arange(20).reshape(-1, 10)
print(f"a = \n{a}")

#access 5 consecutive elements (start:stop:step)
print("a[0, 2:7:1] = ", a[0, 2:7:1], ",  a[0, 2:7:1].shape =", a[0, 2:7:1].shape, "a 1-D array")

#access 5 consecutive elements (start:stop:step) in two rows
print("a[:, 2:7:1] = \n", a[:, 2:7:1], ",  a[:, 2:7:1].shape =", a[:, 2:7:1].shape, "a 2-D array")

# access all elements
print("a[:,:] = \n", a[:,:], ",  a[:,:].shape =", a[:,:].shape)

# access all elements in one row (very common usage)
print("a[1,:] = ", a[1,:], ",  a[1,:].shape =", a[1,:].shape, "a 1-D array")
# same as
print("a[1]   = ", a[1],   ",  a[1].shape   =", a[1].shape, "a 1-D array")
