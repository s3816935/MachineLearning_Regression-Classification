# ## Problem Statement
# 
# You would like a model which can predict housing prices given the size of the house.  
# Let's use the same two data points as before the previous lab- a house with 1000 square feet sold for \\$300,000 and a house with 2000 square feet sold for \\$500,000.
# 
# 
# | Size (1000 sqft)     | Price (1000s of dollars) |
# | -------------------| ------------------------ |
# | 1                 | 300                      |
# | 2                  | 500                      |
# 

x_train = np.array([1.0, 2.0])           #(size in 1000 square feet)
y_train = np.array([300.0, 500.0])           #(price in 1000s of dollars)

# The code below calculates cost by looping over each example. In each loop:
# - `f_wb`, a prediction is calculated
# - the difference between the target and the prediction is calculated and squared.
# - this is added to the total cost.
